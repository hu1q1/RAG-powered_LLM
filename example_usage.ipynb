The 8140 directive replaces the 8570 directive and went into effect on February 15, 2023. The DoD designed the new directive to “provide a targeted, role-based approach to identify, develop and qualify cyber personnel by leveraging the DoD Cyber Workforce Framework (DCWF).” What this means is that all personnel assigned to a position that is coded with a DCWF work role must meet the foundational, residential and continuous professional development qualification requirements outlined for each work role at the assigned proficiency level(s). Member Insights We asked a few of our members working in the space about their thoughts on the new directive, its impact and how it might translate to use in the private sector. Greg Bergen, CISSP, CGRC is a Senior Principal Cybersecurity Analyst for a global aerospace, defense and security company. He told us that as a private contractor, his organization’s alignment with 8570 meant they were well-prepared for the transition to 8140. “DoD 8570 paved the way for a Cyber-certified workforce and the industry is responding in kind to DoD 8140,” he said. “We’re already seeing 8140-compliance stipulated in new contracts and are pushing that down to subcontractors as well.” January 2, 2025 Certifications Key to Unlocking DoD8140 Compliance Tags Register for exam My Account USD $'}\n",

This was one topic of conversation at ISC2’s recent Governance, Risk and Compliance Spotlight event, where host Brandon Dunlap was joined by Daniel Eliot and Stephen Quinn from NIST for an exploration of what is new in release 2.0 of the NIST CSF.

He also noted that unless you run federal networks or critical infrastructure in the U.S. or have some kind of commercial relationship that mandates working to the CSF, the guidance is used entirely voluntarily by the vast majority of those who adopt it, as a purely advisory path to best practice.
